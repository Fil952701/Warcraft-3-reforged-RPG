# Warcraft III – The RPG Experience in Skyrim

Welcome to the official repository of **Warcraft III – The RPG Experience in Skyrim**, a fan-made total conversion project by me that aims to bring the legendary world, characters and campaigns of Warcraft III into the immersive role-playing environment of Skyrim (Special Edition).

> ⚠️ Project in early planning phase – repository currently contains only documentation.

## 🎮 Project Summary

This mod will recreate iconic story arcs from *Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos* and *The Frozen Throne* as narrative-driven RPG quests within the Skyrim engine. The player will experience the events in third-person, assuming the role of a knight in service of Prince Arthas during his infamous march to Strahnbrad and beyond.

This will not be just a visual mod, but a **mechanically rich RPG experience** with:
- Quests and storylines based on the original Warcraft III campaigns
- Real-time dynamic battles and sieges
- Custom NPCs and AI behaviors
- Morality systems reflecting Warcraft’s tragic choices
- Tactical mechanics inspired by RTS elements
- Atmospheric environments faithful to Warcraft’s aesthetics
